                    Hello! I'm Krishna, aspiring to become a web developer. </p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I specialize in front-end development as a web developer, crafting user-friendly websites adorned with captivating designs and meticulously written code.</p>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>I'm skilled in front-end development, adept at crafting websites that engage users through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive experiences. With a solid background in web development and design, I excel at seamlessly integrating images and videos to elevate the visual aesthetics of websites. Additionally, I have a proficiency in C programming and a foundational understanding of Python programming.</p>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I've developed a "Student Registration Portal" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, while employing PHP for the back end and database connectivity. Presently, I'm in the process of creating an application named "Health and Fitness Tracker." This app assists users in monitoring their health and fitness status. Users are required to input their weight and height on a weekly basis, after which the app suggests exercise routines and dietary plans to aid them in achieving their health objectives. Furthermore, it monitors the user's physical activities while they have their smartphone with them.</p>
